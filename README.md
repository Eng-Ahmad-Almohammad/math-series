# Feature Tasks

## fibonacci

### I created a function called fibonacci to find any number related to it index inside the Fibonacci Series starting counting from **zero**
### This function will take one arrgument which is the index of required number 
### Arrgument value must be possitive 
### I used Recursion in this function

## All functions created in same way

## I added tests for this lab two to check first and second number to check Nigative values

## In this lab I worked in master branch because there is no requirment to create new one
